## Demo setup.

* This demo is setup on macOS running SQL Server 2017 on Ubuntu running in a docker container. Install docker container and setup SQL Server 2017 following the simple quide on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-docker

* Demo setup scripts are uploaded to [previewdemo git project](https://github.com/erickangMSFT/previewdemo).
    > Clone the repository to **~/Project/previewdemo** (this important since sqldump.sh script uses this folder. Otherwise, modifie sqldump.sh script to use your own folder)

* Install VSCode and mssql extension just for the demo prep.

* Run following commands.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Projects/previewdemo
    carbon .
    ```

* Creating **PreviewDemoDB**
    * open **~/Projects/previewdemo/initdb/create_previewdemodb.sql** in carbon editor

    * Connect to **localhost, master, sa**

    * Run create_previewdemodb.sql

* Prepare your dockercommands.sh

    * open **~/Projects/previewdemo/bash/dockercommands.sh** in carbon or vscode.

    * open Terminal and get docker container id by running ```docker ps```

    * update ```docker exec``` command in dockercommands.sh file docusing your docker container id

* Download settings.json from email (I will send it) and save it in the previewdemo folder.
    
    * note that settings.json contains MS internal server information and it will not be shared in the previewdemo git repo since it is public.

> review note on 5/26

Making a group as a starting point it is a first class citizen
- have multiple groups
- have groups with different version of servers
- show 2008 connection
- show 2016 connection
- sqltools2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016

Working on simple - basic core properties to provide good experience. And comprehensive view without cluttering

run sqlcmd show itâ€™s on docker / mac But showing more interesting

also using the sqltoolsservice
run mssql-scripter in integrated terminal and run the sql

- have a small db. RE mssql-scripter using it.
- open the sql, check it in, find and replace super heroe 2. 
- show the diff. check it in.
- create database using the script. 



## Post Demo - Areas that we need feedback


1. OE - Basic, Comprehensive, Custom view
    - It should be like survey like question and survey like answers.
		- What was the pain point of OE in SSMS?
		- What we have heard...
		- Proposed solution idea - Option 1. Show Basics only Option 2. Basic, Comprehensive and Custom View
		- Tell us whenever
##### cut		
	- Show settings.json pseudo code to change the mode and show / hide specific OE folder.
    - Show mockup of the result.
    - Show context menu mockup 
        - Explain configuration goes to MANAGE. Operations such as Restore, Failover stays in OE context menu.

2. Manage with Insight
    - Use Audit as an exmaple
    - Show how to configure Audit, Server Audit Spec and Database Audit Spec on OE in a disjoint flow with complexity
    - Show mockup of 
        - Compliance Insight
        - Audit configuration Action

    - Talk about possible Insights and Actions
    - Ask for contribution

3. Simple and Comprehensive object provisioning and manage concept
    - Show mockup of CREATE DATABASE with Simple and Advanced collapsible section.
    - Explain the simple and comprehensive concept.
    - Show Manage with ALTER Property mockup.
