> review note

Making a group as a starting point it is a first class citizen
Working on simple - basic core properties to provide good experience. And comprehensive view without cluttering

run sqlcmd show itâ€™s on docker / mac But showing more interesting

also using the sqltoolsservice
run mssql-scripter in integrated terminal and run the sql

- have a small db. RE mssql-scripter using it.
- open the sql, check it in, find and replace super heroe 2. 
- show the diff. check it in.
- create database using the script. 



## Post Demo - Areas that we need feedback

    - It should be like survey like question and survey like answers.
		- What was the pain point of OE in SSMS?
		- What we have heard...
		- Proposed solution idea - Option 1. Show Basics only Option 2. Basic, Comprehensive and Custom View
		- Tell us whenever
##### cut		
	- Show settings.json pseudo code to change the mode and show / hide specific OE folder.
    - Show mockup of the result.
    - Show context menu mockup
